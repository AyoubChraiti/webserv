## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/42-webserver.git
   cd 42-webserver
```

2. **Build:**
```bash
   make
```

3. **Run:**
```bash
   ./webserv path/to/config.conf
```

## Configuration File

Define servers, ports, document roots, server names, CGI handlers, and more.

``` INI
[server]
    host = localhost
    port = 8080
    server_names = ww.com ayoub.com 
    client_body_limit = 10000000000M

[error_pages]
    400 = www/errors/400.html
    404 = www/errors/404.html
    405 = www/errors/405.html
    411 = www/errors/411.html
    500 = www/errors/500.html
    501 = www/errors/501.html
    505 = www/errors/505.html

[route /]
    alias = www/html/
    index = index.html
    methodes = GET, POST
    allow_upload = true
    upload_directory = upload/

```

**Highlights:**
- `server_name`: Enables multi-virtual hosting.
- `location`: Maps URL paths to filesystem or CGI.
- `cgi`: Configures cgi support for that location.

### Request Handling

- Accepts connections and reads HTTP requests using non-blocking sockets.
- Parses HTTP/1.1 requests, including headers, cookies, and query strings.

### Response Generation

- Generates static file responses, directory listings, or forwards to CGI.
- Handles HTTP status codes, custom error pages, and header management.

### Multiplexing with epoll

- Uses the Linux `epoll` API for event-driven, non-blocking I/O.
- Efficiently manages thousands of simultaneous client connections.

### CGI Execution

- Supports execution of external CGI scripts (Python, PHP, etc.).
- Passes environment variables and request data, collects script output as HTTP response.

### Session Management (Multi-Cookie Support)

- Issues and validates multiple cookies per session (e.g., for authentication, preferences).
- Secure, HTTP-only, and optionally secure cookies for robust session handling.

### Virtual Hosting

- Serve multiple domains from the same server instance.
- Each domain can have unique root, index, error pages, and CGI settings.
